# NODE.JS - API Authentication w/JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

### About

This quick project covers the creation and use of JSON Web Tokens to project routes on your server in NodeJS. We create a basic post route to protect, and a login route to generate a JSON Web Token. We then create a middleware function for our post route to verify the JSON Web Token's authenticity. Finally, we add an expiration date to our generated token for increased security.
